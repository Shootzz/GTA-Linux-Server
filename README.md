## Reason

This is a script that I used and share with my friends to set up a GTA server (FiveM) which useful when you required to re-install your server from scratch without the need of following 25 minutes of tutorials.

## Description

This script will install your server and will open server config for you to configure your server. 

## Usage

After creating your user in linux for GTA, you can use "install.sh" script from home directory of your user to install GTA server. Then, you can start your server by using "start.sh" script.
